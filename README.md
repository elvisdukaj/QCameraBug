# Qt Capture image from Camera

This simple Qt application (built with Qt 5.10.1 64bit on linux) simulate a OpenCV Filter applied to the camera.

I'm using OpenCV to use a very simple Canny filter from the input video frames coming from the camera.

## Usage
If you click to the app a picture is captured and then the picture is displayed. 
If you click again the video continue.

## Bug
The problem is that the taken picture is not filterd! Is this behaviour wanted???
